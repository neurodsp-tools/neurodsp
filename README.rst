Tools to analyze and simulate neural time series, using digital signal processing.

Overview
--------

`neurodsp` is a collection of approaches for applying digital signal processing to neural time series, including algorithms that have been proposed for the analysis of neural time series. It also includes simulation tools for generating plausible simulations of neural time series.

Available modules in ``NeuroDSP`` include:

- ``filt`` : Filter data with bandpass, highpass, lowpass, or notch filters
- ``burst`` : Detect bursting oscillations in neural signals
- ``rhythm`` : Find and analyze rhythmic and recurrent patterns in time series
- ``spectral`` : Compute spectral domain features such as power spectra
- ``timefrequency`` : Estimate instantaneous measures of oscillatory activity
- ``sim`` : Simulate time series, including periodic and aperiodic signal components
- ``plts`` : Plotting functions

Documentation
-------------

Documentation for the ``NeuroDSP`` module is available `here <https://neurodsp-tools.github.io/neurodsp/>`_.

The documentation includes:

- `Tutorials <https://neurodsp-tools.github.io/neurodsp/auto_tutorials/index.html>`_: which describe and work through each module in NeuroDSP
- `Examples <https://neurodsp-tools.github.io/neurodsp/auto_examples/index.html>`_: demonstrating example applications and workflows
- `API List <https://neurodsp-tools.github.io/neurodsp/api.html>`_: which lists and describes all the code and functionality available in the module
- `Glossary <https://neurodsp-tools.github.io/neurodsp/glossary.html>`_: which defines all the key terms used in the module

If you have a question about using NeuroDSP that doesn't seem to be covered by the documentation, feel free to
open an `issue <https://github.com/neurodsp-tools/neurodsp/issues>`_ and ask!

Dependencies
------------

``NeuroDSP`` is written in Python, and requires Python >= 3.5 to run.

It has the following dependencies:

- `numpy <https://github.com/numpy/numpy>`_
- `scipy <https://github.com/scipy/scipy>`_
- `matplotlib <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib>`_

Optional dependencies:

- `pytest <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest>`_ is needed if you want to run the test suite locally

We recommend using the `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>`_ distribution to manage these requirements.

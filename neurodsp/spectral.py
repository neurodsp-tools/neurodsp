    Estimating the power spectral density (PSD) of a time series from short-time Fourier

    Parameters
    -----------
    x : array_like 1d

    Fs : float, Hz
        Sampling frequency of the x time series.
    method : { 'mean', 'median', 'medfilt'}, optional

    """Takes a PSD and changes its power law exponent about a given axis (frequency).

    Parameters
    ----------
    spectrum : array, 1-D
        Power spectrum to be rotated.
    f_axis : array, 1-D, Hz
        Frequency axis of input spectrum. Must be same dimension as spectrum.
    delta_f : float
        Change in power law exponent to be applied. Positive is counterclockwise
        rotation (flatten), negative is clockwise rotation (steepen).
    f_rotation : float, Hz
        Axis of rotation frequency, such that power at that frequency is unchanged
        by the rotation. Only matters if not further normalizing signal variance.

    Returns
    -------
    x : array, 1-D
        Rotated spectrum.

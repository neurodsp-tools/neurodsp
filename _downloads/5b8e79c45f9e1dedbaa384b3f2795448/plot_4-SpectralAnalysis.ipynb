        "Computing the power spectral density (PSD)\n==========================================\nPSD is the frequency domain representation of time series. Through the Fourier transform, the signal is split into orthogonal components of different frequency. In this toolbox, there are a few ways of estimating the PSD:\n  - 'mean' : same as Welch's method; mean over spectrogram of data. This is the most straightforward and \"standard\" way of computing the PSD.\n  - 'median' : similar to Welch's method; median (instead of mean) over spectrogram of data. This diminishes the effect of outlier power values from signal artifacts.\n  - 'medfilt' : median filtered of FFT magnitude squared.\n\n"

This \"1/f slope\" has been found to correlate with aging, memory, and cognitive control in several previous publications, and has been proposed to reflect the physiological balance between excitation and inhibition.\n\nSee for example: Voytek et al., JNeuro, 2015; Podvalny et al., JNeurophysiol, 2015; Gao et al., NeuroImage, 2017; Lombardi et al., Chaos, 2017\n\nHere, we can fit the 1/f slope between any two frequencies while excluding a number of frequency ranges within that fit region, and we can plot the PSD and line to visually evaluate goodness of fit.\n\nNOTE:\nSpectral parameterization (in particular, the 1/f aperiodic component) has been discontinued from neurodsp.\nPlease refer to [FOOOF](https://github.com/voytekresearch/fooof) for a complete and up-to-date spectral parameterizaton.\n\n"

        "## IIR Filters\n\nInfinite impulse response filters are filters for which the response to a single impulse\nis infinite. These filters are sometimes useful due to their efficiency.\n\nIIR filters have an impulse response that is dependent on past values of the impulse\nand impulse response (i.e. recursion or feedback), producing a response that is never zero.\nBecause to this, the IIR filters are not typically applied using convolution.\n\nThe math introduced in the FIR tutorial may be extended to IIR filters, with a\nsecond expression representing feedback:\n\n\\begin{align}y(n) = \\sum_{k=0}^M b_k x(n-k) - \\sum_{k=1}^N a_k y(n-k)\\end{align}\n\n\\begin{align}H(z) = \\frac{\\sum_{k=0}^M b_k z^{-k}}{\\sum_{k=1}^N a_k z^{-k}}\\end{align}\n\nThe IIR filters available in NeuroDSP are Butterworth digital filters, applied using cascaded\nsecond-order sections (SOS), all of which is used from the scipy implementations.\nFor more information on the specifics of these filters, see the scipy documentation.\n\n\n"

Because of this, edges are not automatically excluded, but as\nwe can see edge effects can still be present, and may need to be considered.\n\n\n"

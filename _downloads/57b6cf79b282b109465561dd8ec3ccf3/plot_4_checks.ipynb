        "## Filtering Best Practices\n\nAlthough filtering can increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), improper filter design\nmay result can also introduce confounding distortions and artifacts.\n\nIn order to avoid these issues, filters need to be carefully designed and applied. Some\nguidelines for doing so in the context of electrophysiology data are covered in these\narticles:\n\n- [Widman et al., 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25128257/)\n- [de Cheveigne & Nelken, 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30998899/)\n\nGeneral recommendations based on these articles include to:\n\n1. Consider and examine the frequency and impulse responses of the filter\n2. Use simulated data to evaluate the practical effects of the filter\n3. Manually inspect the filtered signal, and comparing to the original signal\n\nWhen you design and apply filters with NeuroDSP, filter definition and properties checks are\nautomatically applied with the :func:`~.check_filter_definition` and\n:func:`~.check_filter_properties` functions.\n\nIf you see warnings or errors when applying filters, it likely stems from these checks.\nNote that passing these checks does not automatically mean the filter is ideal, but at\nleast some common issues may be caught through this process.\n\n\n"

        "## Filter Attenuation\n\nFilter attenuation refers to the degree to which frequencies are attenuated by a filter.\n\nYou might sometimes see a user warning that warns about the level of attenuation. This\nwarning is given whenever the constructed filter has a frequency response that does not\nhit a specified level of attenuation in the stopband. By default, the warning appears\nif the level of attenuation does not go below -20dB.\n\nYou can check filter properties by plotting the frequency response when you apply a filter.\n\nIn the following example, we will use an example of filtering out line noise, with\ndifferent filter lengths that do and do not achieve sufficient attenuation.\n\n\n"

With shorter filter kernels,\ntemporal resolution increases, but the frequency resolution is worse.\n\n### Two bandpass filters (one long and one short)\n\nFor an example, lets consider two FIR bandpass filters, with different lengths, and how\nthis relates to their filter properties.

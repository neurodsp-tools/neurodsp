        "## Detrended Fluctuation Analysis\n\nDetrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is a method for analyzing the self-similarity of a signal.\n\nDFA is in some ways similar to autocorrelation measures, and is typically used to look\nfor long-range, powerlaw correlations. It does so by dividing the signals into windows,\nfitting local trends, and then examining the pattern across window sizes.\n\nFor more information on the details of DFA, see the description of the algorithm on\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detrended_fluctuation_analysis).\n\n### DFA Exponent\n\nThe output of the DFA algorithm is the 'DFA exponent', which is the slope of the linear fit\nbetween windows sizes and fluctuations. The value of this exponent can be interpreted in\nterms of the properties of the signal.\n\nIn particular, DFA exponents represent:\n\n- $0 < \\alpha < 0.5$ : anti-correlated\n- $\\alpha = 0.5$ : white noise\n- $0.5 < \\alpha < 1$ : correlated (stationary)\n- $\\alpha = 1.0$ : 1/f\n- $1 < \\alpha < 2$ : correlated (non-stationary)\n\n\n"

        "## Applying DFA\n\nHere, to introduce DFA, we will use colored noise signals (white noise and pink noise).\nThese signals have different auto-correlation properties, and so should have different DFA\nresults, which we can then compare between the signals.\n\nNote that DFA can be applied to multiple signal types. Though here we using simulated\naperiodic time series, in analyses of neural field data, DFA is most often used to examine\namplitude time series of neural oscillations.\n\n\n"
